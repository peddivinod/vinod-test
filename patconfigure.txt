Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

Navigate to: Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic).

Click on Generate new token.
Set permissions: Give it appropriate scopes, such as repo (for full repository access).
Generate and copy the token.
Step 2: Use the Token in Place of a Password
When prompted to enter your username and password while using Git commands, use the token as your password:

Update the remote URL (to avoid re-entering the token every time):

git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/your-username/vinod-test.git
Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username, <your-token> with your personal access token, and vinod-test.git with the actual repository name.

Use the Credential Manager (optional):

You can store your credentials in Git’s credential manager so you won’t have to re-enter the token each time:
git config --global credential.helper store
Example Command for Clarity
git remote set-url origin https://your-username:your-token@github.com/peddivinod/vinod-test.git
After this, try pushing again with:

git push origin <branch-name>
This should resolve your authentication issue!
